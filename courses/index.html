		<h2>MPSC</h2>
		<div id="MPSC" class="row">
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<p>Even though there is some awareness about MPSC examination among the rural as well as urban 
					population in Maharashtra, not many think of it as a strong career option. Especially in an industrially 
					developed state like Maharashtra, there is availability of other attractive career opportunities such as 
					Engineering (preferably software engineering), Medical, Management, Architecture so on and so forth.
					Hence the parents as well as students seldom think of MPSC as their very first career option. In addition to this, various misunderstanding about the nature of these exams, suspicions about one’s own abilities,
					lack of awareness about availability of quality guidance and standard reading material etc further distract the students from taking this career option seriously. However, like UPSC, MPSC is also a robust career
					option, which not only can give name, fame as well as a secure, stable and enriching career path but also immense inner satisfaction of serving the society in true sense of the term. MPSC has an added 
					advantage for girls as there is 33% reservation for them in these exams. Maharashtra Public Service Commission is an autonomous constitutional body which recruits personnel for civil services in 
					Maharashtra. Civil Service is a crucial institution, which is responsible for implementing the laws made by the legislature as well as the policies formulated by the government. It also contributes to the process of 
					law and policy making. MPSC has all the ingredients, which are essential to make it a sound career option, namely stability of tenure, attractive salary and social status. But more than that the powers which are 
					bestowed upon the person occupying these posts and the opportunity to utilize these powers for the benefit of the ‘Public’ gives it an edge over the other career options. Because, here in MPSC, along with 
					private gain’, ‘public purpose’ also be served through your career. This sense of fulfillment is the most important thing that makes it a coveted career.

<p>Only the language papers i.e. Marathi and English are descriptive in nature. All- other papers i.e. G. S. papers are objective in nature. Moreover, 
the Commission has introduced negative marking system and individual cut-off for each G.S. paper, 
which is 45% for the General category students and 40% for all the reserved categories. 
Keeping in mind all these changes, the Academy has come up with rigorous batches for MPSC.</p>
